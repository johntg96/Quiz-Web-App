Quiz Web App is a quiz application written for the web with JavaScript and jQuery. Take a quiz and get a final result of your total at the end!

Quizes atm are hardcoded into the "script.js" file, but eventually will be able to be created from within the app itself.

Designed to be multiple question, support for text input at a later date.

Functionality is currently limited, but more features will be added as development continues.
